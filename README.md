# HR Salary Dashboard---Train the Dataset and Predict Salary


To build a salary prediction dashboard for HRs

The project involves implementation of various supervised learning techniques like Logistic regression, Random forest classifier and Support vector classifier. Among them SVC gave the most accuracy score(0.82) after tuning the model. I have used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
